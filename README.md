# VulnStable
## Made this public as this version is depreciated and a new more efficient version is being made for the client.
* Lets users pair with their Hypixel accounts and gives them the role for the rank that they have in the guild
* Kickoffline returns a paginator that contains everyone that hasn't logged in 3 days, is below level 20 and has gotten less than 21k gexp in the past 7 days
# Will not work for you as it is hard coded to work for my client, you can try modifying it though
